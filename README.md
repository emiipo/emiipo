hihi you can call me Emi! I'm currently the Co-Founder and Team Lead at [SD Games](https://sdgames.co.uk/) and we're working on our first game [Eternal Damnation](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2576280/Eternal_Damnation). I take up many jobs here so you might find me developing new systems, working on existing ones, level designing, managing company stuff, updating the website or messing with our linux server to ease development. In my free time I've recently been getting into Arch Linux and sorting out gaming on linux, I also mess around with my private server and host several personal applications like an IPTV channel emulator or a minecraft server :) I also love exploring interesting tech so once in a while I'll try to combine two pieces of tech that should not work together hehe~
