## Hii there 👋
I am Emily, I'm studying Computer Science and am part of the [DevSoc](https://devsoc.co.uk/home.html) committee. I see myself as very creative and besides software development I love creating & exploring different kinds of art forms. Some of the artsy things I like to invest my time into are various fictional worlds, 3D modeling, drawing art, doodling and reading stories. Switching around my style and changing things up is a must for me as it gives me a sense of something new and let's me refresh my daily routine with unfamiliar and spontanious things~
